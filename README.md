# ResQVision

**GPU-Accelerated Battlefield Casualty Prioritization using CUDA Attention, Drone Vision, and ResQBand-Inspired Telemetry**

---

## Overview

ResQVision is a research-oriented simulation platform for real-time battlefield casualty prioritization.

The project explores how modern AI attention mechanisms can be accelerated using NVIDIA CUDA and applied to battlefield medical triage scenarios.

A simulated drone observes the battlefield while soldiers continuously transmit physiological telemetry inspired by the ResQBand concept. The system processes this information using a CUDA-accelerated scaled dot-product attention engine and generates evacuation priorities in real time.

ResQVision now includes:
* CUDA Attention Engine
* JSON export pipeline
* React tactical dashboard
* Attention visualization layer
* Rule-based operational recommendations

The dashboard consumes CUDA-generated outputs and visualizes battlefield decision-support information.

## Quick Start

> Run from the **project root** (`ResQVision/`) for all commands below.

### One-time setup (Windows)

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

This creates a Python virtual environment, installs all dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and runs `npm install` inside `frontend/`.

---

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install      # skip if setup.ps1 was already run
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

---

### YOLO Demo

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment first
venv\Scripts\activate

python scripts/yolo_detect.py --image scripts/sample_input.png
```

Outputs written to `frontend/public/data/`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `detections.json` | Per-person detection results |
| `detection_preview.jpg` | Annotated frame with bounding boxes |

The Computer Vision page in the dashboard picks these up automatically.

---

### CUDA

```bash
nvcc -O2 resqvision.cu -o resqvision
./resqvision
```

Then export results to JSON:

```bash
python scripts/csv_to_json.py
```

---

### JSON Integration

After running the CUDA binary or YOLO script, generated JSON files live in:

```
frontend/public/data/
├── benchmark_results.json
├── risk_ranking.json
├── attention_stats.json
└── detections.json
```

The dashboard loads these files on startup. If any file is missing or malformed, it falls back to built-in mock data automatically — so the demo always works.

---

## Project Motivation

Modern battlefield environments generate large volumes of information from sensors, wearable devices, drones, and communication systems.

Medical teams and commanders must rapidly identify the most critical casualties and allocate evacuation resources efficiently.

Traditional sequential processing may become a bottleneck as the number of monitored soldiers increases.

ResQVision investigates how GPU-accelerated attention mechanisms can process battlefield telemetry in parallel and provide real-time casualty prioritization for large-scale scenarios.

The project combines concepts from:

* Parallel Computing
* CUDA Programming
* Artificial Intelligence
* Medical Decision Support
* Defense Technology
* Computer Vision

to create a realistic simulation of next-generation battlefield triage systems.

## JSON Integration Workflow

CUDA Output
↓
CSV Files
↓
JSON Export
↓
frontend/public/data
↓
React Dashboard

Artifacts include:
* `benchmark_results.json`
* `risk_ranking.json`
* `attention_stats.json`

**Fallback behavior:**
If JSON files are unavailable, the dashboard automatically falls back to mock data.

---

## Attention Visualization Layer

`attention_stats.json` contains:
* `soldier_id`
* `max_attention`
* `mean_attention`
* `entropy`

* Top 3 attention targets → red halo
* Next 3 attention targets → orange halo
* Remaining targets → blue halo

The visualization is derived directly from CUDA attention outputs.

---

## Operational Decision Support

The dashboard features a Recommended Action Engine that derives actions from:
* Risk ranking
* Casualty category
* Physiological status

Example actions:
* Evacuate Soldier 388
* Dispatch Trauma Team Bravo
* Route UAV-1 to casualty cluster
* Monitor Soldier 282

**Note:** This is a rule-based prototype and not a clinical decision system.
